This program is used to manipulate items that are given to the input in the form of a text file.

This is an extremely easy to read program that is easy to use. Very straight foward.

I could probably add a way for the user to specify a place to save the file, or add a way for the user to choose the file it reads.

The most difficult parts of the code were the Python, because I didn't know how it worked. I read a lot about how it works and realized that it literally just copies what it is given to the output. This made everything a lot easier.
I always consult StackOverflow!

I can use any of the skills I have learned during my readings in the future. C++ is an extremely useful programming language!

I made it maintanable by following industry standards. By following industry standards, it made the code adaptable. I made it readable by utilizing white space correctly, as well as leaving comments where they are needed.
